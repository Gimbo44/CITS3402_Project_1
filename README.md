The deliverables:

- The first deliverable is of course your modified C code with appropriate OpenMP directives. You should also comment      your code suitably, so that the code itself can be read and your modifications can be understood.

- You have to also submit a (reasonably) small document where you should explain how you have implemented the parallelism   in the code and why. It should also contain extensive performance evaluation of your code with different parameters. I   am not looking for anything specific here, rather well designed performance evaluation and speed-up results that         highlight your work.
- The main emphasis in the evaluation of your project is on how extensively you have done your experiments and how well    you have documented the results of your experiments. You should not despair if you do not get spectacular speed up. You   should concentrate more on well thought out experiments that you have performed and that you believe should improve the   runtime performance of this code.

Marks: 

- The total marks for this project is 25 (15 marks for the quality of your experiments, 8 marks for the quality of the     report and 2 marks for innovative solutions). I will evaluate the project through a comparative assessment, i.e.,        against the best submission from the class.
